# Reasonings on InceptionNet

This project aims to visualize how the InceptionNet V3 model decide the output of any images, basically finding an explanation of the model. By using a [lime algorithm by marcotcr](https://github.com/marcotcr/lime), we can analyze if the model actually look at the correct region of an input or not. 

For ease of use, we create a user-interface on a webpage (ongoing work) to show explanations on any given images.
